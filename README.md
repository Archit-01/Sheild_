SHEild is an innovative safety device designed to empower women and enhance their personal security in emergencies. The device operates through a simple button mechanism. When the button is pressed, a 10-second timer is initiated. During this time, the system waits for a second button press to confirm the SOS signal. If the button is pressed again within the 10 seconds, the SOS is confirmed, and the device retrieves pre-stored emergency contacts from memory. It then sends an alert message via a GSM module, ensuring rapid communication with the designated contacts. If no second press occurs, the SOS request is canceled, and no action is taken. This streamlined and user-friendly process provides a quick and reliable way for women to seek help, offering a vital lifeline during critical situations.
